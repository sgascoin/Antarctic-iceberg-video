# Antarctic Iceberg Video

This video shows Antarctic icebergs that are named and tracked by the [U.S. National Ice Center](https://usicecenter.gov/Products/AntarcIcebergs) (2014-2023). The circle diameter is proportional to the iceberg size. I labelled only the largest ones.

My code to generate the video from USNICE files is also available ([notebook](Antarctic-iceberg-video.ipynb)).
